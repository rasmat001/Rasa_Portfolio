### Marketing Analysis (Session Time Analysis)

The task was to analyze overall trends of all marketing campaigns on Google Merchandise Store and find out if users tend to spend more time on the website on certain weekdays and how that behavior differs across campaigns.

- [Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/ae97231a-987f-4a40-8bf5-b33b7ca753a3) (Looker Studio), [Query](https://github.com/rasmat001/Rasa_Portfolio/blob/main/queries/Session%20Time%20Analysis%20(Marketing).sql)

Main findings:
- Lower user engagement on the weekends (fewer and shorter user sessions)
- Most of the sessions and revenue comes from Referral and Organic traffic 
- The most successful paid marketing campaigns was Black Friday and Holiday - they generated most revenue, had higher conversion rate and lower cost per acquisition. Whereas Data Share Promo and New Year campaigns had more sessions, but very low conversion rate and higher cost per acquisition

### Product Analysis (Time to Purchase Analysis)

The task was to identify how much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on the website (from first arriving on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day). I have also looked into how much time it takes for a user to reach each purchase funnel event.

- [Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/oy-xRp5uNXs) (Looker Studio), [Query](https://github.com/rasmat001/Rasa_Portfolio/blob/main/queries/Time%20to%20Purchase%20(Product).sql)

Main findings:
- Median time to purchase is 18 minutes
- A user spends longest time (10min) between adding first item to the cart and starting checkout
- It takes 4 min to complete a purchase after adding payment info. To improve customer experience we could investigate how to shorten this time

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) - Cohort Analysis

The task was to calculate CLV using cohort analysis and predict future CLV using cumulative growth % from cohorts where we have data already.
